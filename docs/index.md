# Overview

<img class="overview-image" src="assets/images/prototype-4/lesson-1-banner.png">

First things first, we will create a new prototype and download the starter files! Youâ€™ll notice a beautiful island, sky, and particle effect... all of which can be customized!

After creating a new project and importing our assets, it's time to get started with the player controls. First we'll allow the player to rotate the camera around the island, providing a glorious view of the scene. The player will be represented by a sphere, wrapped in a detailed texture of your choice. Finally we'll will add force to the player, allowing them to move forwards or backwards in the direction of the camera.
